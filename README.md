# M1F Example Sheets
M1F 2018-19 example sheets in Lean

# Where are the example sheets?

In a directory called `src`.

# Where are all the rest of them?

I am in the process of moving everything here. It takes time. I am rewriting all my proofs, because 1 year ago my Lean code was even worse than it is now.

If you're interested in this repo, then you might be interested in the following links:

1) The "problem bank" 

https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/tree/master/M1F/problem_bank

-- this was my original plan, but I'm moving everything to this repository now.

2) My own (abysmal!) attempts from last year:

I have every intention of tidying all of this up (and in particular writing some library code
which the students don't have to worry about), however I am extremely busy at the
minute with work matters (unrelated to M1F or Lean) so I've not had time to concentrate on this.

# I am an Imperial College First Year. How can I run Lean?

There are loads of easy ways. You don't have to install anything. Lean is on all the computers in the MLC
and there are other ways too.
