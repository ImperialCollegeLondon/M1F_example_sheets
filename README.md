# M1F Example Sheets
M1F 2018-19 example sheets in Lean. Currently we have much of the first 6 sheets, both questions and solutions.

# Where are the example sheets?

In a directory called `src`.

# Where are all the rest of them?

Some are written but not here, some are not written, some I wrote last year and they don't compile any more. My Lean was even worse last year than it is now so a lot of what I wrote last year needs updating.

If you're interested in this repo, then you might be interested in the following links:

1) The "old problem bank" 

https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/tree/master/M1F/problem_bank

-- this was my original plan, but I'm moving everything to this repository now.

2) My own (abysmal!) attempts from last year:

https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/tree/master/M1F/2017-18

-- there is now almost nothing of value here; everything of any use is either now here or in the old problem bank.

I have every intention of tidying all of this up (and in particular writing some library code
which the students don't have to worry about), however I am extremely busy at the
minute with work matters (unrelated to M1F or Lean) so I've not had time to concentrate on this.

# I am an Imperial College First Year. How can I run Lean?

There are loads of easy ways. You don't have to install anything. Lean is on all the computers in the MLC
and there are other ways too.

# How can I get help learning how to use Lean?
