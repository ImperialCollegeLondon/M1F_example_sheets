# M1F Example Sheet
M1F 2018-19 example sheets in Lean

In a directory called `src`.

# Where are all the rest of them?

I am in the process of moving everything here. It takes time.
If you are that Swedish guy who keeps asking about sheet 2, then you might be interested in the following links:

1) The "problem bank"

I have every intention of tidying all of this up (and in particular writing some library code
which the students don't have to worry about), however I am extremely busy at the
minute with work matters (unrelated to M1F or Lean) so I've not had time to concentrate on this.

and there are other ways too.

# How can I get help learning how to use Lean?
